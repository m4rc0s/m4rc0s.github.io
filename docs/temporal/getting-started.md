# Getting Started With Temporal

Some notes about my getting started moment with temporal

## Setup Local Development Environment

Temporal setup is quite simple if you use docker and docker compose. I strongly recommend setup with Temporal Compose Files, so you can get in touch with temporal features and development experience in minutes.

### Running Temporal Locally with Docker Compose

```sh
mkdir my-temporal-workdir && cd mkdir
git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose
cd docker-compose && docker-compose up -d
```
